# .config

Collection of all my MacOS/Linux configuration files.

## Installation

This should ideally install and configure all tools required for development,
including IDE, aliases, themes, fonts, etc.

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## TODO

- [x] nvim(telescope): support hiddent files across the board
- [] nvim: improve cursor positioning (keep around the middle of the screen)
- [] nvim: disable continuous scrolling on key press&hold
- [] terminal: improve fs navigation
- [x] nvim: improve open buffer navigation & management
- [] env: use ansible or nix to have a reproducible development environment
- [] (optional) go: use tree-sitter bindings to navigate between
  functions/args/etc.
