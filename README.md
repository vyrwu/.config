# .config

Collection of all my MacOS/Linux configuration files.

## Installation

This should ideally install and configure all tools required for development,
including IDE, aliases, themes, fonts, etc.

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## TODO

- [] terminal: improve fs navigation
- [] env: use ansible or nix to have a reproducible development environment
- Usability improvement: switch between dark/light mode via keybinding
- Problem: tmux session management is chaotic
- [] (optional) go: use tree-sitter bindings to navigate between
  functions/args/etc.
