# .config

Collection of all my MacOS/Linux configuration files.

## Initial installation

Requires a working [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) installation.

## TODO

- Remove reliance on Brew in favour of Nix
- Switch between dark/light mode via keybinding
- Create keybindings for tree-sitter objects (functions/args/etc.)
- Find a way to follow up on industry news (newsboat)
- Automatically sync specific git repos (git-sync)
- Install Nix flake directly from GitHub
- Check in my Oryx keyboard layout to Version Control
- Load encrypted secrets checked into GitHub into a shell. Store encryption key
  on Yubikey.
